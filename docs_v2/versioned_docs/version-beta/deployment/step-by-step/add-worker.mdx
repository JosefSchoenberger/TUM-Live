# Worker

Workers are responsible for recording your lecture halls, transcoding recordings and pushing these to your shared storage.

## Add a Worker to the GoCast network

<Tabs
  defaultValue="docker"
  values={[
    {label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
    {label: 'Manually', value: 'manually'},
    {label: 'Using a cloud provider', value: 'cloud'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="docker">

1. Run the TUM-Live-Worker docker container with the organization token and make sure to include its hostname and address:

   ```sh
   docker run -d \
   -p 50051:50051 \
   -p 8060:8060 \
   -p 8085:8085 \
   -p 1935:1935 \
   -e Token=<your-organization-token> \
   -e MainBase=live.rbg.tum.de \
   -e Host=$(hostname) \
   -e Address=<your-worker-addr>
   -e LrzUploadUrl=<your-vod-service-addr>:8089 \
   -e LogLevel=debug \
   -e PersistDir=/persist \
   -e VodURLTemplate=<your-edge-server-addr>/vod/%s.mp4/playlist.m3u8 \
   -v /path/to/recordings:/recordings \
   -v /path/to/persist:/persist \
   -v /path/to/mass:/mass \
   -v /path/to/workerlog:/var/log/stream \
   ghcr.io/tum-dev/gocast/worker:latest
   ```

2. _Optional_: Join your docker node cluster:
   ```sh
   # Refer to your manager node on which token to use here:
   docker swarm join --token ABC-1243-DEFG 1.2.3.4:2377
   ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manually">

1. Clone the GoCast repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tum-Dev/gocast
   ```
2. Change into the runner directory:

   ```sh
   cd gocast && cd worker
   ```

3. Start the Worker with the organization token and make sure to include its hostname:
   ```sh
   Token=<your-organization-token> \
   MainBase=live.rbg.tum.de \
   Host=$(hostname) \
   LrzUploadUrl=<your-vod-service-addr>:8089 \
   LogLevel=debug \
   PersistDir=/persist \
   VodURLTemplate=<your-edge-server-addr>/vod/%s.mp4/playlist.m3u8 \
   go run ./cmd/worker/main.go
   ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cloud">

    1. Create a new instance on your cloud provider.

    2. Install Docker on the instance.

    3. Follow the instructions for the Docker tab to run the worker and make sure to expose the necessary ports.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Verify successful deployment

Once a Worker has been added successfully, you should be able to see it in the ["resources"-tab](https://live.rbg.tum.de/admins/organizations) of the admin dashboard.

Here's an example of how it should look, if you added three Workers (one of which didn't start successfully):
