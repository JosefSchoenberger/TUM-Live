This guide contains information on how to stream from your own computer.

## Gather streaming key.

### Method 1: Using lecturer token (recommended)

- Open the token panel of the admin page ([here](https://live.rbg.tum.de/admin/token)).

- Create a new token by clicking on the `+` button.

- Copy the token and paste it into the streaming software of your choice.

:::danger
Do not share your token with anyone. It is unique to you and allows access to your streams. If you suspect that your token has been compromised, please delete it and create a new one.

### Method 2: Using course admin page

- Navigate to the stream and click `show keys`.
