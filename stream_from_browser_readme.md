# Lights, Camera, Browser Stream!

Welcome, intrepid explorer of the digital stream-iverse! Prepare for an exciting journey that will take you from the comfort of your browser to the far reaches of live streaming with Livekit. We've designed this guide to be your trusty map as you set up your local environment to stream from the browser via Livekit. Buckle up; it's going to be a fun ride!

## Pre-Flight Checks

Before we blast off, we'll need to make sure your spaceship (read: computer) is outfitted with the right gear. You will need the following software installed. Don't worry, these aren't alien tech; they are readily available for your acquisition:

- [livego](https://github.com/gwuhaolin/livego): Like the engine of our spacecraft, enabling us to cruise through the video streaming galaxy.
- [livekit-server](https://github.com/livekit/livekit): Think of it as the command center, receiving, coordinating, and managing signals.
- [redis instance](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis): Our navigational star chart, storing data and ensuring a smooth journey.

Once you've got these installed, power them up to run locally. They will erect a server fortress that stands ready to accept incoming transmission requests.

## Configuring The Booster Rocket

There's one last bit of kit we need to optimize before we're off to the races:

- [livekit egress container](https://github.com/livekit/egress)

Think of this egress server as our booster rocket, enabling us to break free of gravity and stream into the cosmos. You can find setup instructions on its dedicated GitHub page. These should guide you through the setup, just like a short and sweet astronaut training session!

Now you're fully equipped for your mission. Godspeed on your streaming adventure!
